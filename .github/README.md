# dotfiles

My dotfiles, managed with [`dgit`](../.local/scripts/dgit): a bare Git repo whose work tree is `$HOME`.

## Install

You need `git` and `curl` (or `wget`). The repo is cloned over HTTPS, so no SSH key is needed to install; one is needed later to pull and push.

**Linux / macOS / Git Bash on Windows:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drednaught608/dotfiles/main/.github/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell** (runs the same script through Git for Windows' bash):

```powershell
& "$env:ProgramFiles\Git\bin\bash.exe" -c "curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drednaught608/dotfiles/main/.github/install.sh | bash"
```

The [install script](install.sh):

1. Downloads `dgit` to `~/.local/scripts/dgit`.
2. Runs `dgit clone https://github.com/Drednaught608/dotfiles.git`, then `dgit reset --hard origin/main` so `$HOME` matches the repo exactly.
3. Switches `origin` to `git@github.com:Drednaught608/dotfiles.git` for pushing.
4. If `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` exists, runs `updatessh` (below).

Before the reset, any existing file that would be overwritten is copied to `~/.local/share/dotfiles/backup-<timestamp>/`, and an existing dgit repo is moved there too, not deleted.

## SSH key

Copy your key pair (`id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`) into `~/.ssh`, then run:

```bash
updatessh
```

It sets `~/.ssh` permissions so ssh accepts the key: `700` for the directory, `600` for private keys and `config`, and `644` for `.pub` and `known_hosts`. On Windows it also sets owner-only ACLs with `icacls`, which Windows OpenSSH requires. Then it checks that the key authenticates to GitHub.

## Usage

```bash
dgit status
dgit add ~/.vimrc
dgit commit -m "Update vimrc"
dgit push
```

Run `dgit help` for more.
